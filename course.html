        <b><u>Adobe Photoshop</u></b> is a raster graphics editor developed and
        published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created
        in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto
        industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word
        "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image,"
        "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such
        use.
